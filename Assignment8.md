The video that was the most helpful to me was Predicate Logic video. I was struggling alittle to grasp the concept of the material, 
I understood it just I needed more clarification on a couple areas of the topic. The video really broke every down to the fundamental level
 and explained in detail how predicate logic works. After watching the video it cleared up the questions I had and helped me understand
 the topic more.
